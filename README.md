📝 Summary of Findings
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher fare passengers tended to survive more (likely in higher classes).

Pclass and Sex showed strong correlation with survival.

Outliers were present in the Fare column.
